# GitHub Crash course

This repo is designed for ESM 206 FA 22 to make up for not having a lab session detailing github. Materials are taken from happygitwithr and Allison Horst's lecture materials from previous ESM 206 condensed into one day session. Our session will be broken down into four parts. Estimated time to complete is included in paranthesis. Students should have a github account set up and Git installed on their computer. Windows users will most likely need to download it from GitBash.

## Set up (10 minutes if all goes well)

Get Rstudio, Git, and Github to all communicate with each other. 

## Fork a Repo (20 minutes)

Students will fork this repo to have a stored record of the materials and to practice staging, committing, and pushing. Instructions are contained in github_instruct.html

## Set up individual Repo (20 minutes)

Instructions continue in github_instruct.html

Main points, setting up a Readme file, private vs public, and gitignore

## Collaborate with Git (20 minutes)

Renae and I will do a brief demonstration showing the power of collaboration with Github. We will be using my [Github demo](https://github.com/nggrimes/github_demo_206) repository. In this repo, the collab_practice.html contains the instructions if students want to practice on their own.
